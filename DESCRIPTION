Description: Format dates and times flexibly and to whichever locales
    make sense. Parses dates, times, and datetimes in various formats (including
    string-based ISO-8601 constructions). The formatting syntax is quite
    powerful; time zones in the input can be expressed in multiple ways and
    there are many options for formatting time zones in the output as well.
    Several of the provided helper functions allow for automatic generation of
    locale-aware formatting patterns based on date/time skeleton formats and
    standardized date/time formats with variable specificity.
