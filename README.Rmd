# i18n

The goal of i18n is to easily get localized variants of dates, times, currencies, and other stuff that can be localized with some degree of precision.

## Some Examples

Here is a date-time string that's all ISO 8601:2004: `"2018-07-24T14:44:22.234343-0800(America/Vancouver)"`. Let's take that as our input going forward.

```{r input}
input <- "2018-07-24T14:44:22.234343-0800(America/Vancouver)"
```

There are standardized date forms across all locales. They come in 4 flavors: `short`, `medium`, `long`, or `full`. Let's get that date-time into each of these forms, with random locales:

```{r short_en}
input %>%
  fmt_date_time_standard(
    locale = "en",
    width = "short"
  )
```

```{r medium_de}
input %>%
  fmt_date_time_standard(
    locale = "de",
    width = "medium"
  )
```

```{r long_fr_BE}
input %>%
  fmt_date_time_standard(
    locale = "fr_BE",
    width = "long"
  )
```

```{r full_es_MX}
input %>%
  fmt_date_time_standard(
    locale = "es_MX",
    width = "full"
  )
```

We can also apply a smattering of different simple date format presets to this input. The `format_w_pattern()` function is useful for this. We can choose to keep the date portion, the time portion, or both. The `fdf()` helper function is useful for choosing a preset date format from the flexible date format (FDF).

```{r format_w_pattern_es_date}
input %>%
  fmt_date_time(
    date_format = fdf("yMd"),
    time_format = NULL,
    locale = "es")
```

Time components have presets under the flexible time format (FTF), which is split into 12- and 24-hour variants. There are `ftf_12()` and `ftf_24()` helper functions enable selections of presets within those.

```{r format_w_pattern_es_mx_date_time}
input %>%
  fmt_date_time(
    date_format = fdf("yMd"),
    time_format = ftf_24("EHms"),
    locale = "es_MX")
```

It's hard to know what the format names are for `fdf()`, `ftf_12()`, and `ftf_24()`, so, there are information functions that provide the names and yield previews. These info functions are: 

- `info_fdf_types()`
- `info_ftf_12_types()`
- `info_ftf_24_types()`

Here, we can specify a combining pattern by using a locale specific version with the `date_time_combine()` helper function. In this case, we select the `"full"` combining pattern for the `"de_AT"` locale.

```{r format_w_pattern_de_at_dt_combine}
input %>%
  fmt_date_time(
    date_format = fdf("yMd"),
    time_format = ftf_24("Hms"),
    combination = date_time_combine("full"),
    locale = "de_AT")
```

There is indeed an info function available to help determine which combining pattern to use, it's `info_date_time_combine()`.

Here is a comparison table of localized dates for all the presets available in the flexible date format:
