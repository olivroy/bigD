# bigD

The goal of **bigD** is to flexibly format dates and times to a given
locale.

Given the ISO-8601 date string `"2018-07-04"` we can use formatting
strings to precisely get the date in the form we need.

``` r
fmt_dt(input = "2018-07-04", dt_format = "y/M/d")
```

    2018/7/4

``` r
fmt_dt(input = "2018-07-04", dt_format = "MMMM d, y.")
```

    July 4, 2018.

With the `locale` option, we can localize the date.

``` r
fmt_dt(input = "2018-07-04", dt_format = "d. MMMM y (EEEE).", locale = "de")
```

    4. Juli 2018 (Mittwoch).

With a datetime string, we have more possibilities.

``` r
fmt_dt(
  input = "2018-07-24T14:44:22.234343-0800",
  dt_format = "MMM dd HH:mm:ss ZZZZ yyyy",
  locale = "fr"
)
```

    juil. 24 14:44:22 GMT-8:00 2018

``` r
fmt_dt(
  input = "2018-07-24T14:44:22.234343-0800",
  dt_format = "MMMM dd HH:mm:ss 'yy XX",
  locale = "fi"
)
```
