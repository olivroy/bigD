  - title: 'The Main Function: `fdt()`'
    desc: >
      The `fdt()` function is the one that takes in your date/time/datetime
      (in whichever way you want to provide it) and provides ways to format
      that input in a flexible manner.
    contents:
    - fdt

  - title: Locale Helpers
    desc: >
      You have the option to format dates times according to a specified locale,
      and there are hundreds of locales. These helpers make selecting a locale
      (and knowing which are formally supported here) much more convenient.

    - fdt_locales_lst
    - fdt_locales_vec

  - title: Flexible Date and Time Helpers
    desc: >
      Flexible dates and times (divided into 12- and 24-hour variants) embody
      the idea of canonical forms that are translated faithfully across many
      different locales. The vector objects (`*_vec`) show which of these forms
      are available and the list objects (`*_lst`) can be directly used to form
      an input value for `fdt()`'s `format` argument (e.g.,
      `format = flex_t24_lst$Hms`).
    contents:
    - flex_d_lst
    - flex_d_vec
    - flex_t24_lst
    - flex_t24_vec
    - flex_t12_lst
    - flex_t12_vec

  - title: Standard Dates and Times
    desc: >
      Standard dates and times follow the convention of four different types
      ("short", "medium", "long", and "full") that are specially formulated for
      each and every locale. These helper functions provide a simple interface
      for choosing a standardized formatting pattern. Invoke any one of them as
      an input value for `fdt()`'s `format` argument (e.g.,
      `format = standard_date_time(type = "medium")`).
    contents:
    - standard_date_time
    - standard_date
    - standard_time
