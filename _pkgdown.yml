  - title: 'The Main Function: `fdt()`'
    desc: >
      The `fdt()` function is the one that takes in your date/time/datetime
      (in whichever way you want to provide it) and provides ways to format
      that input in a flexible manner.

  - title: Locale Helpers
    desc: >
      You have the option to format dates times according to a specified locale,
      and there are hundreds of locales. These helpers make selecting a locale
      (and knowing which are formally supported here) much more convenient.

  - title: Flexible Date and Time Helpers
    desc: >
      Flexible dates and times (divided into 12- and 24-hour variants) embody
      the idea of canonical forms that are translated faithfully across many
      different locales. These helpers show which of these are available for
      dates, 12-hour time, and 24-hour time.

    - flex_t12_lst
    - flex_t12_vec
    - flex_t24_lst
    - flex_t24_vec

  - title: Standard Dates and Times
    desc: >
      Standard dates and times follow the convention of four different types
      ("short", "medium", "long", and "full") that are specially formulated for
      each and every locale. These helper functions provide a simple interface
      for choosing a standardized formatting pattern.
